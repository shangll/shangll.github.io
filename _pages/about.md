My research interest lies in information processing to understand how individuals interact with the external world, with a special focus on workload capacity and efficiency of the visual memory search by which how the brain optimally responds to variations can be investigated.

*Keywords*: information processing, workload capacity/processing efficiency, categorization, DNNs (e.g., AlexNet, VGG, NLP), associative memory, semantic/visual memory search, hybrid search, visual object recognition

Skills: **EEG (preferred)**, fMRI; C, MATLAB, **Python**, **R**

Current Program
======
Program: How we see what is new: The role of attention and object attributes in visual memory search

Supervisor: Marius Peelen - [Visual Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/donders-centre-for-cognition/visual-cognitive-neuroscience)

Institution: Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour in Netherlands (Nijmegen)
