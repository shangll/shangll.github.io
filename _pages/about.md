My research interest lies in information processing to understand how individuals interact with the external world, with a special focus on workload capacity and efficiency of the visual memory search by which how the brain optimally responds to variations can be investigated.

*Keywords*: information processing, workload capacity/processing efficiency, categorization, DNNs (e.g., AlexNet, VGG, NLP), associative memory, semantic/visual memory search, hybrid search, visual object recognition
